# This requirement uses a VCS URL and `-e` in order to test that:
#  - Git from the stack image can be found (ie: the system PATH has been correctly propagated to pip).
#  - The editable mode repository clone is saved into the dependencies layer (via the `--src` option).
#
# A C-based package is used instead of a pure Python package, in order to test that the
# Python headers can be found in the `include/pythonX.Y/` directory of the Python layer.
#
# The URL to the package is specified via env var, to test that user-provided env vars
# are propagated to pip for use by its env var interpolation feature.
