# This requirement uses a VCS URL and `-e` in order to test that:
#  - Git from the stack image can be found (ie: the system PATH has been correctly propagated to pip).
#  - The editable mode repository clone is saved into the dependencies layer (via the `--src` option).
#
# The psycopg2 package is used instead of a pure Python package, in order to test that:
#  - The Python headers can be found in the `include/pythonX.Y/` directory of the Python layer.
#  - Headers/libraries from the stack image can be found (in this case, for libpq-dev).
