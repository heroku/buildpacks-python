# The default `miniz_oxide` flate2 backend has poor performance in debug/under QEMU:
# https://github.com/rust-lang/flate2-rs/issues/297
# Ideally we'd use the fastest `zlib-ng` backend, however it fails to cross-compile:
# https://github.com/rust-lang/libz-sys/issues/93
# As such we have to use the next best alternate backend, which is `zlib`.

# [profile.dev]
# Speed up downloading/extraction of Python during integration tests.
# TODO: Test again to see if it's still worth it, now that the Python archives are smaller + using alternate flate2 backend.
# (now only seems to change the E2E pack build time of an app using urllib3 from 23.4s to 21.8s on M1?)
