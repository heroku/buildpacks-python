# The default `miniz_oxide` flate2 backend has poor performance in debug/under QEMU:
# https://github.com/rust-lang/flate2-rs/issues/297
# Ideally we'd use the fastest `zlib-ng` backend, however it fails to cross-compile:
# https://github.com/rust-lang/libz-sys/issues/93
# As such we have to use the next best alternate backend, which is `zlib`.
